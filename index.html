				<h2 class="first-h2">Abstract</h2>
				<p>
					Although deepfakes have many positive applications, they have serious negative
					 effects as well. In this project, we utilize deep learning methods, the technology
					 employed in creating deepfakes, to combat its negative effects. We use the Facebook
					 Deepfake Detection Challenge dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/data" target="_blank">[1]</a>, containing over 100,000 videos, both real
					 and altered, of people. The focus of this project is the development and training of
					 various deep models to effectively detect deepfake videos, as well as the extensive
					 data processing required to reduce the size of the massive Facebook Deepfake Detection
					 Challenge video dataset. By creating an ensemble of deep neural networks, including a
					 3D CNN and CNN-LSTM models, we were able to detect deepfake videos with 87% accuracy
					 on a balanced test dataset.
