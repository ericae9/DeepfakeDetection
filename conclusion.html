				<p>
					Although deep learning methods are used to create deepfakes, deep learning
					 methods can also be used to detect deepfakes. As demonstrated by the performance
					 of the ensemble method previously described, deepfakes can be detected with high
					 accuracy, helping to neutralize the negative effects of deepfakes. With future
					 work, given additional computational resources, we could further improve the
					 accuracy of our models by developing deeper CNNs and reducing the effect of
					 vanishing gradients utilizing skip connections. Another idea worth exploring to
					 boost accuracy is to add more models to the ensemble, training these models in
					 parallel, and placing the output of each model in a feature vector format, which
					 would then be passed to another model, trained to predict whether a video is real
					 or fake based on the predictions of all models in the ensemble. Currently, our
					 ensemble simply averages the output from the 3D CNN and CNN-LSTM to determine a final prediction.
